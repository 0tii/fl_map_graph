# Fl_Map_Graph
Flutter widget that draws a line graph for a map-based dataset.

## Requirements
Requires a map of interval data, where the key index corresponds to a chronological x value and value to the respective y-value. That means that unevenly spaced data is not suitable for map graph. 

(Note that if your data is suitable, but your keys do not qualify as axis labels, you can specify a label override.)

Requires Flutter >= 2.2.x, no additional dependencies.

## Usage

## About
Map Line Graph is not standardized and limited in some aspects. This is due to the fact that it is primarily a widget for proprietary use.
